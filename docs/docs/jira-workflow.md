# Jira Workflow Guide 📘

We'll walk you through some steps to get started with our Jira workflow.

## Understanding the Workflow States

Our Jira board consists of several columns, each representing a different state in the lifecycle of a task:

- `TODO`: The starting point for all issues.
- `BLOCKED`: Tasks that are blocked by some factors.
- `IN PROGRESS`: Tasks in progress. 
- `VERIFICATION`: Tasks be checked and reviewed.
- `DONE`: Completed tasks.

## Working with Tickets

### Picking up a Ticket

1. **Start in the `TODO` Column**  
   - 📝 Every task that needs to be done is listed here.
   - To take on a task, click `assign to me` to Assign a ticket to yourself. 

2. **Moving to `IN PROGRESS`**
   - Drag it to the `IN PROGRESS` column, or click on it and change its status.
   - ⏳ Once you start working on a ticket, ensure it's assigned to you, and the status is set to `IN PROGRESS`.
   - This signals to the team that someone is actively working on that task.

### Handling Blockers

- **Identifying a `BLOCKED` Task**  
   - ❌ If you encounter an impediment, move the ticket to the `BLOCKED` column.
   - Provide a comment on the ticket detailing what the blocker is.

### Completing a Task

1. **Progressing to `VERIFICATION`**  
   - 🔍 After completing the work on a task, move it to the `VERIFICATION` column.
   - This is where your work will be reviewed and tested. It may involve peer review or QA testing, depending on the task.

2. **Finishing Up with `DONE`**  
   - ✅ Once verified, the ticket can be moved to the `DONE` column.
   - This indicates the task is completed and meets all acceptance criteria.

## Additional Tips for Jira Use

- Make sure to add comments to your tickets to provide context and updates for your teammates.
