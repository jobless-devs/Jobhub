### 🌅 What's On The Horizon? 
Being newcomers to these technologies, we're still in the blueprint phase. Here's a roadmap:
1. 🧭 Broaden our horizons by researching more capabilities and tools.
2. 🛠️ Finalize our tech stack and architectural design.
3. 📝 Segment the project into sizable tasks.
4. 🔍 Further dissect these tasks into actionable tickets that can be individually managed.
5. 🤝 Collaborate during the foundational setup.
6. 🖥️ Build a functional, user-friendly application.
7. 🚀 Launch to the web.
8. 🚪 Open our doors to external developer contributions, expanding beyond just CS roles.

In-depth documentation 📚 will accompany the project, ensuring that even those with minimal experience can jump in and contribute. It's an exciting venture, especially for those keen on exploring Amazon Web Services (AWS) and the intricacies of software development.

### 🌟 Potential Extensions:
- **User Profiles**: Tailored by major, experience level, and more.
  - 🎨 Custom experiences can be curated based on these details.
- **More Platforms**: The more, the merrier. 🎉
  - 🕷️ Custom scrapers will be necessary due to unique site structures.
- **Notifications**: 📧 Email or messages via AWS SNS for daily updates.
- **Resume Review**: 📄 Share your CV and receive constructive feedback (or a gentle roast 🍖).

... and countless other possibilities! 🌌
