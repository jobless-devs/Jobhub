## We will get you all the jobs you ever wanted to find~ 

### Inspiration
The co-op job search can be daunting. Think about how often you input keywords like:
When you are in the co-op job search process. You'll search for 
- Software Engineer Intern 
- Software Engineer Co-op 
- Software Developer Intern 
- Software Developer Co-op 
- Data Engineer Intern 
- Data Engineer Co-op 

...and so on. You diligently place these into platforms like Indeed, LinkedIn, Glassdoor, and more. Initially, enthusiasm fuels your search, but after weeks without success, it can wear you down. 

Enter "_JobHubSFU.com_", where you're greeted by a curated list of job opportunities, aggregated from various platforms based on common search terms. One-click takes you directly to the application. 

Our mission is to ease your transition from student to professional and guide you into the next chapter of your career.

### What's On The Horizon? 
Being newcomers to these technologies, we're still in the blueprint phase. Here's a roadmap:
1. Broaden our horizons by researching more capabilities and tools.
2. Finalize our tech stack and architectural design.
3. Segment the project into sizable tasks.
4. Further dissect these tasks into actionable tickets that can be individually managed.
5. Collaborate during the foundational setup.
6. Build a functional, user-friendly application.
7. Launch to the web.
8. Open our doors to external developer contributions, expanding beyond just CS roles.

In-depth documentation will accompany the project, ensuring that even those with minimal experience can jump in and contribute. It's an exciting venture, especially for those keen on exploring Amazon Web Services (AWS) and the intricacies of software development.

### Potential Extensions:
- **User Profiles**: Tailored by major, experience level, and more.
  - Custom experiences can be curated based on these details.
- **More Platforms**: The more, the merrier.
  - Custom scrapers will be necessary due to unique site structures.
- **Notifications**: Email or messages via AWS SNS for daily updates.
- **Resume Review**: Share your CV and receive constructive feedback (or a gentle roast).

... and countless other possibilities!
